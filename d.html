<h3>1.Malicious Software(s) (Malware)</h3>
<p>
Malicious software, or malware, is any program or code intentionally created to harm, disrupt, or exploit computer systems, networks, or users. Malware is one of the biggest threats in the digital world, and it can affect individuals, businesses, and even governments. It comes in many forms:<br>

<br><strong>Viruses:</strong> These attach to files or programs and spread when the infected files are shared. They can delete, corrupt, or modify data.</strong><br>

<br><strong>Worms:</strong> Unlike viruses, worms do not need a host file. They replicate themselves across networks and can cause system slowdowns or crashes.<br>

<br><strong>Trojans:</strong> These disguise themselves as legitimate software but carry harmful actions that execute once installed.<br>

<br><strong>Ransomware:</strong> Encrypts a user’s files and demands payment to decrypt them. It can lock businesses out of essential systems for days.<br>

<br><strong>Spyware:</strong> Secretly collects user information, such as browsing history, passwords, or banking information.<br>

<br><strong>Adware:</strong> Usually less harmful, it displays unwanted ads and sometimes tracks user behavior for marketing purposes.<br>

Malware can steal sensitive information, disrupt normal operations, or cause financial loss, making it critical to use antivirus software, firewalls, and to practice safe computing habits.

<h3>Cyber Security Technologies</h3>
<p>
Cybersecurity technologies are tools and methods used to protect digital systems, networks, and data from cyber attacks. These technologies work in three main stages: Prevention, Control, and Management.<br><br>

<strong>a) Prevention (Before an Attack Happens)</strong><br>
Prevention is about stopping threats before they cause damage. Some common tools include:<br>
Firewalls: Act as barriers between trusted and untrusted networks, blocking suspicious traffic.<br>
Antivirus/Anti-malware: Scan, detect, and remove malicious programs before they can infect systems.<br>
Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS): Monitor networks for unusual activity and block attacks automatically.<br>
Encryption: Converts data into a coded format so even if intercepted, it cannot be read.<br>
Access Controls & Strong Authentication: Ensure only authorized users can access sensitive systems or data.<br>
<br><strong>b) Control (During an Attack)</strong><br>
Control tools reduce the impact while an attack is happening:<br>
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Watch networks and systems for suspicious activity and alert administrators.<br>
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): Collects and analyzes data from various sources to detect ongoing attacks in real-time.<br>
Network Segmentation: Divides networks into smaller parts to prevent malware from spreading.<br>
Automated Threat Response Tools: Isolate affected systems to stop the attack from spreading further.<br>
<br><strong>c) Management (After an Attack)</strong><br>
Management tools help recover from attacks and prevent them in the future:<br>
Data Backup & Recovery Systems: Restore lost or damaged files.<br>
Digital Forensics Tools: Investigate how the attack happened and identify responsible parties.<br>
Patch Management: Fix vulnerabilities that attackers exploited.<br>
Incident Response Plans: Predefined steps to handle breaches efficiently, reduce downtime, and protect reputation.<br>
Using these tools together forms a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, which reduces risks, mitigates damage, and ensures quick recovery.<br>
