<h3>1. ICT Policy in Nepal</h3>
<p>
The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Policy of Nepal (also sometimes referred to as an IT policy) is a government policy that guides how technology should be used for national development. The most recent formal version, often called the ICT Policy 2072 (2015 BS), aims to transform Nepal into an information and knowledge‑based society and economy. The vision of this policy is to help make ICT a key driver of development by ensuring the widespread access to digital services and technologies. It promotes the use of ICT in education, government services, and business to improve transparency, efficiency, and public participation. <br>It also focuses on building reliable and secure national ICT infrastructure, increasing digital literacy, and encouraging innovation and private sector involvement in technology. The policy includes specific objectives such as improving internet access across the country, promoting e‑governance and online public services, and supporting e‑commerce, research, and human resource development in ICT fields.<br><br>

For example, the ICT policy puts emphasis on developing national infrastructure to support secure and reliable communication, expanding broadband and internet access to rural areas, and creating opportunities for learning and innovation. It’s meant to help Nepal keep up with global ICT progress and ensure that citizens, businesses, and government services benefit from digital technology.</p></br>

<h3>2. Cyber Laws in Nepal</h3>
<p>
In Nepal, the main law that deals with electronic transactions and many cyber activities is the Electronic Transactions Act, 2063 (2008 AD). This act was passed by the Government of Nepal to give legal recognition to electronic records and digital signatures, which means that electronic documents and digital signatures are treated as valid and legally enforceable, much like paper documents and handwritten signatures.<br><br>

The law also provides a legal framework for secure electronic communications and transactions. It sets out rules on authentication, regulation, and the reliability of electronic records and data communication, and it includes provisions to penalize various kinds of harmful digital activities. These include unauthorized access to computer systems, damaging or altering electronic information, and publishing illegal or harmful content online. The act also makes provisions for the licensing of certifying authorities who issue digital certificates for secure communication.<br><br>

The Electronic Transactions Act was an important step for Nepal because before this law, electronic documents and digital signatures had no clear legal status, which made it difficult to conduct official business online. Now electronic transactions and communications can be used confidently for government services, online applications, and even legal notices.</p><br><br>
