    <h2>Introduction to Information Security</h2>
    <p>
        Information security, often called InfoSec, is the practice of protecting 
        information so that it remains safe, accurate, and accessible to the right people. 
        Information can exist in many forms — digital files stored on computers, data in cloud systems, 
        printed documents, or even recorded media. No matter the form, the main goal of information 
        security is to protect the value and reliability of that information.

    <h2>Introduction to the CIA Triad</h2>
    <p>
        The CIA Triad is a fundamental model used in information security to guide 
        policies and practices for protecting data. It provides a simple but effective framework 
        for understanding how information should be secured. In this context, CIA does not refer 
        to the intelligence agency. Instead, it represents three core principles: 
        Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. These three components together form the 
        foundation of modern information security systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>
        Confidentiality ensures that information is accessible only to authorized individuals. 
        Sensitive data such as passwords, personal records, financial details, or official 
        documents must be kept private. Methods such as encryption, user authentication, 
        and access controls are used to maintain confidentiality. When confidentiality is 
        properly maintained, only the intended users can view the information.
    </p>

    <h2>Integrity</h2>
    <p>
        Integrity means that information must remain accurate, complete, and trustworthy. 
        Data should not be changed, modified, or deleted without proper authorization. 
        Maintaining integrity ensures that information can be relied upon for decision-making. 
        For example, academic records, legal documents, and financial statements must remain 
        correct and unaltered unless officially updated.
    </p>

    <h2>Availability</h2>
    <p>
        Availability ensures that information and systems are accessible to authorized users 
        whenever needed. It ensures that data is not only protected but also usable. Systems 
        should function properly so that users can retrieve information without unnecessary delays. 
        Backups, maintenance, and proper system management help ensure availability.
    </p>

    <p>
        Together, confidentiality, integrity, and availability form the foundation of information 
        security. These principles guide how organizations design policies and manage data 
        effectively. Information security is ultimately about keeping information private, 
        accurate, and accessible only to the right people at the right time.
